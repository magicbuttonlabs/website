# magicbuttonlabs.com — Site Parking Lot

Site-specific open decisions and deferred items for the live magicbuttonlabs.com instance. Standards-level items live in the Web Standards canon's `parking-lot.md`, not here.

> Created 2026-05-30 — first site-specific parking lot, per the canon's note ("create `magicbuttonlabs/website/parking-lot.md` when the first site-specific item arises"). When something resolves, note it inline or remove it.

## Done — logged for continuity

### CJ content file brought to the Page Content Standard
**Status:** Done 2026-05-30
**What:** `cj-website-content.md` upgraded to the three-block skeleton (Shared copy · Render deltas · Section map) defined by the Page Content Standard in the canon's `project-context.md`. Existing copy was left untouched; the Render Deltas (6) and Section Map blocks were added. Deltas were sourced from the real CJ 2-pager (`cj-intro-onepager.html`) in the Claude Project, not guessed.
**No artifact copy changed:** the website page and the 2-pager were not edited — only the content file gained its structural blocks.

## Open

### CJ hero headline divergence (parked — deliberate)
**Status:** Parked (carried from `topic-alignment-website-to-2pager.md` Gap #2)
**Context:** Website hero = "The way every business *wishes* it ran." 2-pager hero = "Your whole business, *finally* in one place." Two headlines for the same product, different register for different reader states. Recorded as Delta 1 in `cj-website-content.md`.
**Action needed:** Decide whether to unify or keep the intentional divergence. Do NOT sync them silently — resolve the parked decision first.

### CJ 2-pager must live in the "Monday Website" Project
**Status:** Open — desktop
**Context:** `cj-website-content.md` references the CJ 2-pager (`cj-intro-onepager.html`) as living "in the Claude Project." It currently sits in the prior chat's project. For the reference to hold from the new "Monday Website" Project, the 2-pager file needs to be in that Project (same trip as the Foundation Build 2-pager).
**Action needed:** Add `cj-intro-onepager.html` (and `foundation-build-2pager.html`) to the Monday Website Project.

### `customer-journey-v2.html` stub — triage
**Status:** Open
**Context:** A 512-byte `customer-journey-v2.html` exists in this Trove alongside the full `customer-journey.html` (63KB, the live page). A tiny stub like this is usually a leftover or a placeholder for a planned rework — exactly the kind of stray file that causes "which one is live?" confusion later.
**Action needed:** Confirm what it is — delete if leftover, or note its purpose if it's a planned v2 staging file.

### Foundation Build content file — 2-pager side unverified
**Status:** Open (cross-ref `foundation-build-content.md`)
**Context:** The Foundation Build content file's 2-pager copy carries ⚠️ markers — reconstructed from a prior session, not verified against an actual `foundation-build-2pager.html` (which isn't in the Trove or a Project yet).
**Action needed:** Get the Foundation Build 2-pager into the Monday Website Project, then clear the ⚠️ items.
